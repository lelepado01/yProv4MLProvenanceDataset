A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 0), following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), and creating a user namespace at www.example.org. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id: 466, started by user lelepado, with python 3.10.5 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun 14 2022, 07:06:46) [GCC 10.3.0], and named IBM_outliers. 
The entire experiment was run in a None environment, The experiment was scheduled at 2025-04-09 12:35:23 and it finished at 2025-04-09 12:48:15, for a total of 772.17 seconds. 
The model was trained for 12 epochs. The user saved a set of parameters from the process, including: execution_start_time, execution_end_timeA set of metrics have been collected from the process, in particular in the contexts TRAINING, these metrics are Outlier_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_temperature_Context.TRAINING, cpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, disk_usage_Context.TRAINING, Outliers_Context.TRAINING, Step_time_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Context.TRAINING, gpu_memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, Indices_Context.TRAINING, gpu_usage_Context.TRAINING.
