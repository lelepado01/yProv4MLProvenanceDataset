A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 0), following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), and creating a user namespace at torch. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id: 0, started by user gabrielepadovani, with python 3.11.8 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Feb 16 2024, 20:53:32) [GCC 12.3.0], and named 400M_2N. 
The entire experiment was run in a None environment, The experiment was scheduled at 2024-08-01 14:48:07 and it finished at 2024-08-01 14:49:07, for a total of 60.27 seconds. 
The model was trained for 4 epochs. with the final version being MAE_400M. The final model has a total of 400000000 parameters, and the footprint on the memory is of 1.64 Mb. The user saved a set of parameters from the process, including: execution_start_time, model_build_time, data_loading_time, training_time, execution_end_time, model_name, total_params, memory_of_model, total_memory_load_of_modelA set of metrics have been collected from the process, in particular in the contexts TRAINING, these metrics are gpu_power_Context.TRAINING, cpu_power_Context.TRAINING, gpu_energy_Context.TRAINING, gpu_temperature_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_usage_Context.TRAINING, cpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, cpu_energy_Context.TRAINING, disk_usage_Context.TRAINING, train_step_time_Context.TRAINING, energy_consumed_Context.TRAINING, memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Context.TRAINING, ram_power_Context.TRAINING, gpu_memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, ram_energy_Context.TRAINING, emissions_rate_Context.TRAINING, emissions_Context.TRAINING.
