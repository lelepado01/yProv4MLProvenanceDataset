A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 0), following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), and creating a user namespace at www.example.org. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id: 0, started by user gabriele.padovani, with python 3.9.21 (main, Dec  5 2024, 00:00:00) 
[GCC 11.5.0 20240719 (Red Hat 11.5.0-2)], and named MobileViTv2Attention_performance_GR0. 
The entire experiment was run in a None environment, The experiment was scheduled at 2025-06-05 10:17:46 and it finished at 2025-06-05 10:23:20, for a total of 333.98 seconds. 
The model was trained for 22 epochs. The model was saved 1 times, in the checkpoints prov/MobileViTv2Attention_performance_0/artifacts/final.pt/final.pt_0.pth. with the final version being final.pt. The final model has a total of 4234827 parameters, and the footprint on the memory is of 16.94 Mb. The user saved a set of parameters from the process, including: execution_start_time, model_name, total_params, memory_of_model, total_memory_load_of_model, execution_end_timeA set of metrics have been collected from the process, in particular in the contexts VALIDATION, TRAINING, these metrics are Time_Pretraining_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Pretraining_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Pretrain_Context.VALIDATION, Time_Finetuning_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Finetuning_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Finetuning_Context.VALIDATION, Accuracy_Finetuning_Context.VALIDATION.
