A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 0), following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), and creating a user namespace at www.example.org. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id: 294, started by user lelepado, with python 3.10.4 (main, Mar 31 2022, 08:41:55) [GCC 7.5.0], and named IBM_outliers. 
The entire experiment was run in a None environment, The experiment was scheduled at 2025-03-31 18:31:23 and it finished at 2025-03-31 18:34:41, for a total of 197.91 seconds. 
The model was trained for 42 epochs. The user saved a set of parameters from the process, including: execution_start_time, execution_end_timeA set of metrics have been collected from the process, in particular in the contexts TRAINING, these metrics are Outlier_Context.TRAINING, Backward_time_Context.TRAINING, Optim_step_time_Context.TRAINING, Outliers_Context.TRAINING, Step_time_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Context.TRAINING, Indices_Context.TRAINING.
