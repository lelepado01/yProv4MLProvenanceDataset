A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 0), following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), and creating a user namespace at www.example.org. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id: 0, started by user bunino1, with python 3.11.3 (main, Jun 25 2023, 13:31:54) [GCC 12.3.0], and named 3DGAN. 
The entire experiment was run in a None environment, The experiment was scheduled at 2024-07-25 14:23:11 and it finished at 2024-07-25 15:24:13, for a total of 3662.32 seconds. 
The model was trained for 1752 epochs. The model was saved 2 times, in the checkpoints mllogs/prov_logs/3DGAN_0/artifacts/generator_epoch_1/generator_epoch_1.pth, mllogs/prov_logs/3DGAN_0/artifacts/generator_epoch_0/generator_epoch_0.pth. with the final version being model.ThreeDGAN. The final model has a total of 1399625 parameters, and the footprint on the memory is of 0.06 Mb. The datasets used for the training of the model are: 
The user saved a set of parameters from the process, including: execution_start_time, optimizer_discriminator, optimizer_generator, model_name, total_params, memory_of_model, total_memory_load_of_model, loss_fn, init_args, _instantiator, execution_end_timeA set of metrics have been collected from the process, in particular in the contexts VALIDATION, TRAINING, these metrics are ram_power_Context.TRAINING, gpu_energy_Context.VALIDATION, emissions_rate_Context.VALIDATION, gpu_temperature_Context.VALIDATION, gpu_memory_usage_Context.VALIDATION, train_epoch_time_Context.TRAINING, cpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, generator_loss_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_usage_Context.TRAINING, cpu_power_Context.TRAINING, gen_loss_Context.TRAINING, cpu_energy_Context.TRAINING, memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, fake_batch_loss_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_usage_Context.VALIDATION, val_discriminator_loss_Context.VALIDATION, cpu_energy_Context.VALIDATION, ram_energy_Context.VALIDATION, emissions_rate_Context.TRAINING, gpu_temperature_Context.TRAINING, epoch_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_Context.TRAINING, gpu_usage_Context.VALIDATION, ram_energy_Context.TRAINING, gpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, cpu_usage_Context.VALIDATION, ram_power_Context.VALIDATION, emissions_Context.VALIDATION, emissions_Context.TRAINING, disk_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_Context.VALIDATION, disk_usage_Context.VALIDATION, gpu_memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, train_epoch_time_Context.VALIDATION, gpu_energy_Context.TRAINING, energy_consumed_Context.VALIDATION, cpu_power_Context.VALIDATION, epoch_Context.VALIDATION, Loss_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Context.VALIDATION, memory_usage_Context.VALIDATION, energy_consumed_Context.TRAINING.
