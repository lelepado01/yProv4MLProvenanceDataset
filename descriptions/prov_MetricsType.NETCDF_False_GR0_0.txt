A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 1), not following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), namespace MetricsType.NETCDF_False_GR0_0. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id 0, started by user gabrielepadovani, with python 3.12.2 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Feb 16 2024, 20:54:21) [Clang 16.0.6 ], and named Original prov4ml_torch.py. 
The entire experiment was run in a single core environment, and the user also attached a source code file, as the local file /Users/gabrielepadovani/Desktop/Università/Prov/yProvML/examples/prov4ml_torch.py. The experiment was scheduled at 2025-08-31 16:22:02 and it finished at 2025-08-31 16:22:02, for a total of 0.12 seconds. 
The model was trained for 8 epochs,each epoch consisting in the passthrough of 5 samples, with batch size 16. The model was saved 3 times, in the checkpoints mnist_model_version_0, mnist_model_version_1, mnist_model_final. with the final version being mnist_model_final. The final model has a total of 7850 parameters, and the footprint on the memory is of 0.03 Mb. The datasets used for the training of the model are: train_dataset with 5 shuffled samples, 16 batch size and 5 steps; val_dataset with 5 not shuffled samples, 16 batch size and 5 steps.
