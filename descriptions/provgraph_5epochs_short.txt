A provenance file created using the yProv4ML library (version 0), following the W3C prov schema (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema#), and creating a user namespace at www.example.org. The file contains a machine learning process with run_id: 5, started by user gabrielepadovani, with python 3.12.7 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct  4 2024, 08:22:19) [Clang 14.0.6 ], and named experiment_name. 
The entire experiment was run in a None environment, The experiment was scheduled at 2025-03-07 11:15:02 and it finished at 2025-03-07 11:31:43, for a total of 1000.58 seconds. 
The model was trained for 18 epochs. with the final version being mnist_model_final. The final model has a total of 7850 parameters, and the footprint on the memory is of 0.03 Mb. The datasets used for the training of the model are: 
The user saved a set of parameters from the process, including: execution_start_time, loss_fn, execution_end_time, model_name, total_params, memory_of_model, total_memory_load_of_modelA set of metrics have been collected from the process, in particular in the contexts VALIDATION, TRAINING, these metrics are ram_power_Context.TRAINING, memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_temperature_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Context.VALIDATION, cpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_usage_Context.TRAINING, cpu_energy_Context.TRAINING, emissions_rate_Context.TRAINING, Loss_Context.TRAINING, gpu_memory_usage_Context.TRAINING, energy_consumed_Context.TRAINING, emissions_Context.TRAINING, gpu_energy_Context.TRAINING, ram_energy_Context.TRAINING, disk_usage_Context.TRAINING, gpu_power_Context.TRAINING, cpu_power_Context.TRAINING.
